Interviewing is a universal experience, but it is no one’s job.

Interviews are the gateway between people and jobs — they are a critical connection point. And yet, while the interview is a universal experience, it has never been recognized as its own discipline. In fact, the 
vast majority of people conducting interviews receive no formal training in how to do so.

Karat is the market leader in Interview Engineering.

At Karat, our mission is to make every interview predictive, fair, and enjoyable. To do so, we created and established the category of Interview Engineering.
